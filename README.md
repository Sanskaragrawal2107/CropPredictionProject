# 🌾 Crop Prediction Model

Welcome to the **Crop Prediction Model** project! 🎉 This project is designed to help farmers and agricultural experts predict the most suitable crop to grow based on several conditions like soil type, temperature, humidity, and more.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, we use machine learning to predict which crops can be grown in specific environmental conditions. The model takes input features like soil composition, temperature, humidity, and others to suggest the best crop. Additionally, we’ve built a simple interface where users can input these details and get predictions easily!

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used to build the machine learning model.
- **Flask**: For building the backend to handle user requests and connect the ML model.
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the user interface where inputs are taken and predictions are shown.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: To handle data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For the machine learning part, including the RandomForestClassifier.

## 🌟 Features

- **Predict Crop**: Enter details like soil type, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and get the best crop prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple, no-fuss web interface to interact with the model.
- **Backend Integration**: The model is powered by a Flask backend, making the predictions seamless.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https:/Sanskaragrawal2107/github.com//CropPredictionProject.git
   ```

2. **Install the Required Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask Application**:
   To start the app and serve the prediction model, run:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open the Web Interface**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You’ll see a form to input your data!

## 📝 Inputs Required

When testing the model, you’ll need to input the following features:

- **N_SOIL**: Nitrogen level in the soil.
- **P_SOIL**: Phosphorus level in the soil.
- **K_SOIL**: Potassium level in the soil.
- **TEMPERATURE**: Current temperature in degrees Celsius.
- **HUMIDITY**: Current humidity percentage.
- **ph**: Soil pH level.
- **RAINFALL**: Rainfall in mm.
